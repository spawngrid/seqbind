SeqBind
=======

Problem
-------

Does it bother you that some of your code looks like this?

```erlang
 L1 = lists:map(fun (X) -> ... end, L),
 L2 = lists:filter(fun (X) -> ... end, L1)
 %% or
 {Q,Req1} = cowboy_http_req:qs_val(<<"q">>,Req),
 {Id,Req2} = cowboy_http_req:qs_val(<<"id">>,Req1)
```

Solution
--------

While there are some solutions available to address this, such as giving variables more descriptive names or extracting each step into a separate function, this might not be particularly  suitable for every case. Providing descriptive names still doesn't assist with reordering and having too many function calls may add complexity and unnecessary overhead.

SeqBind offers a different, yet simple, solution to this problem.

It introduces the concept of sequential bindings. What is that? Sequential bindings are bindings that carry the suffix `@` (like `L@` or `Req@`) for example.

SeqBind is a parse transformation that auto-numbers all occurrences of these bindings following the suffix @ (creating `L@0`, `L@1`, `Req@0`, `Req@1`) and so on.

In order to use SeqBind, one should enable the `seqbind` parse transformation, this can be done either through compiler options or by adding the line below to your module:

```erlang
-compile({parse_transform,seqbind}).
```

General Rules
---

There are few rules to be followed.

### Left and Right


In the matches (such as `A@ = 1`) the side of the match is significant to SeqBind. Even though in Erlang itself it is not, this agreement allows SeqBind to do its job.

The basic idea is that if you have a sequential binding on the left, its counter will be incremented. If it's on the right, the current counter value will be used.

As a consequence of this, one should be aware, that the commonly used syntax of:

```erlang
#state{} = State@
```

Notice that because the bound variable is on the right; it will, as a result, not increment the counter for `State@` (with the noted exception of when this syntax is used in a function clause). In order to achieve the intended result, one should do:

```erlang
State@ = #state{}
```

### Matching

If instead of incrementing a sequential binding's counter you actually just want to match its value while putting it on the left side, you simply drop the suffix like so:


```erlang
State@ = get_state(),
State = get_state_again()
```

The same goes to `case`,`if` and `receive` clauses, also note that you cannot `seqbind` a variable after it has been declared, it must come first.
